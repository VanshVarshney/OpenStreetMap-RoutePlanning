The following project is a part of Udacityâ€™s C++ NanoDegree program. The aim of project is to successfully find the shortest path between two points on the map.

- Map data from OSM XML file is parsed and the optimal path is plotted using IO2D Library in C++; 
- Used GoogleTest Framework for unit testing.

The Project
---

The steps of this project are the following:

* Parsing the data from OpenStreetMap file (.OSM xml file)
* The user inputs two points on the map and initial and final points
* Route planner is executed
  * Based on the points input by the user, the closest initial and final nodes are found.
  * A list of feasible open nodes is updated.
  * Based on a heuristic value and the distance from the start node, next node is popped.
  * From the popped node, the open list is again updated.
* The process is repeated till either the next node is the goal, or the open list is exhausted.
* The path is returned and plotted used IO2D library.

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```
### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```
./OSM_A_star_search
```
Or to specify a map file:
```
./OSM_A_star_search -f ../<your_osm_file.osm>
```

## Testing

The testing executable is also placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the unit tests as follows:
```
./test
```
